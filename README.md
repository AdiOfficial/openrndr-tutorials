# OPENRNDR examples

This repository contains examples that accompany the OPENRNDR guide.

## Running the examples

The adviced way of running the examples is to create a new project from existing sources in IntelliJ. Examples can be launched by right-clicking on the widget next to the main() functions.

Note that on OSX an additonal step is required. The JVM argument `-XrunOnFirstThread` has to be added in the run configuration.
